#hAppy Habit Triangles v0.1

This is the initial development for a habit tracking app, adapted from Launch School's Todo Tracker project in module RB175.

Note re: file structure:
When I incorporated the FlatUI bootstrap pack I decided to keep its css and js seperate so it could be easily removed again. This explains why there are multiple folders for stylesheets and js assets.
