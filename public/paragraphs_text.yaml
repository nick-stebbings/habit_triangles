    Welcome to **Happy Habit Triangles**
    
    In essence, this is a FRACTAL habit tracker.

    To begin, describe an objective that you would like to pursue, or simply a habit that you would like to form.
  
:objectives:
  :old: This dashboard allows you to take a quick glance at a list of habits - those linked by objective.

  :update: Here you can get an over view of the sub-habits that you have chosen to associate with this objective.

:action_list:
  :intro: >
    Since you've labelled this habit as *atomic*, we can break it down into a few simple actions which you can check off each day.

    Add items to the list - simple steps or 'things to remember' that will help you each day.

    Tick off items and it will save it for you automatically.

    Or, click 'Complete Habit for Today' to mark the habit as done for the day!

:existing_habit:
  :new: >
    You've created a new habit to track, so you're well on the way to establishing some new behavior.
    Now let's break it down into smaller pieces. 

  :old: >
    This is where you can view and adjust the details of your habit. If you have decided this habit is *atomic*, or is about a certain aspect of your life, you can label it so.

  :sub_info: >
    Give the habit a description, and a tag for the aspect of your life that it covers.

    Now we want to find out if this is an _atomic_ habit, that we could reduce to a list of actions.

    Mark with a tick if you've decided if it is _atomic_, then click 'start tracking' to make it a simple list.

  :tooltip_atomic: Once you mark a habit as atomic and click 'Update', you will create an Action list which makes completing the habit each day a breeze!

  :tooltip_completed: Did you do this today?

  :tooltip_streak: Number of days in a row with the habit completed

:fractal:
  :old: >
    View the progress of your habit(s).
    If you have decided that a habit needs breaking down further, go to its *Summary* page and set it to **Atomic**.
    Go to the habit's *Objective* page to start stacking habits.
    If the habit is Atomic, click *Tasks* to create a list of simple steps.

  :tooltip_day_toggle: Click to toggle completion of the highlighted day
