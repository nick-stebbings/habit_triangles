    Welcome, dear user, to Happy Habit Triangles. This application fuses a few useful productivity and lifestyle hacks that I have encountered and found to be useful.

    After beginning my studies at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com) I was introduced to a different way of learning.
    To encourage a focus on mastery in my education, I was pointed toward the book ['Mastery : the keys to long-term success and fulfillment'](https://archive.org/details/masterykeystolon00leon) by George Leonard.
    The key takeaway is the emphasis on process, rather than results. Proper process is the way to build skill. It takes as long as it takes.

    In my personal life I have been drawn towards habit tracking apps, as a way of creating stability in my day-to-day shcedule.
    I find they can be useful, but a linear approach to monitoring personal behaviour, in my life, often breaks down. When I break a habit streak I feel like everything is broken!

    In order to drill down into the details of why I do and don't do certain things, I am making this application. In essence, it is a FRACTAL habit tracker.

    To begin, enter an objective that you would like to pursue, or simply a habit that you would like to form.

  :second: This is the second

  :referred: You've made a objective, now let's break that up into different habits. We'll start with one. Let's try and think of a key habit that is really important for making the objective a reality.
