    This is Davey.

    Davey is unhappy. Lately, whatever he seems to do, he can't get out of his own way. On some days he will be very motivated to achieve his goals and get a buzz from making progress towards them. On other days he feels lost and dejected, and does little to further his aims.

    Sometimes, when he is procrastinating, Davey finds inspirational videos online, which spur him into momentary action.

    This helps in the short term, but he finds that before long his motivation fades and he is once more frustrated and not able to consistently move forward with the things he wants to build.

    Davey wants to build consistent habits. He needs them to have a strong foundation, just like the pyramids.
    He needs a <em>hAppy Habit Triangle</em>.
