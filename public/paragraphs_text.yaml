    Welcome to *Happy Habit Triangles*
    
    In essence, this is a FRACTAL habit tracker.

    To begin, enter an objective that you would like to pursue, or simply a habit that you would like to form.

    You've created a new habit to track, so you're well on the way to establishing some new behaviour.
    Now let's break it down into smaller pieces. 

    We've given the habit a description, and a tag for the aspect of your life that it covers.
    Now we want to find out if this is an _atomic_ habit, that we could reduce to a list of actions.

    Check the box once you've decided if it is atomic, then click 'start tracking'.

    To decide, ask yourself this:
    - Is it a general behaviour, like 'eat healthy food'?
    - Or is it a specific set of actions?

#     This application fuses a few useful productivity and lifestyle hacks that I have encountered and found to be useful.

#     After beginning my studies at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com) I was introduced to a different way of learning. To encourage a focus on mastery in my education, I was pointed toward the book ['Mastery : the keys to long-term success and fulfillment'](https://archive.org/details/masterykeystolon00leon) by George Leonard.
#     The key takeaway is the emphasis on process, rather than results. Proper process is the way to build skill. It takes as long as it takes.

#     In my personal life I have been drawn towards habit tracking apps, as a way of creating stability in my day-to-day schedule.
#     I find they can be useful, but a linear approach to monitoring personal behaviour, in my life, often breaks down. When I break a habit streak I feel like everything is broken!

#     In order to drill down into the details of why I do and don't do certain things, I am making this application.
