    Welcome to **Happy Habit Triangles**
    
    In essence, this is a FRACTAL habit tracker.

    To begin, enter an objective that you would like to pursue, or simply a habit that you would like to form.

  :new: Here is your chance to make a fresh start in one of your patterns of behavior. If you would like to 

  :old: Track the status of each of the sub-habits.

:existing_habit:
  :new: >

    If you have decided that a habit needs breaking down further, go to its *Summary* page and set it to **Atomic**.

    Go to the habit's *Objective* page to start stacking habits.

    If the habit is Atomic, click *Tasks* to create a list of simple steps.

  :sub_info: >
    We've given the habit a description, and a tag for the aspect of your life that it covers.
    Now we want to find out if this is an **atomic** habit, that we could reduce to a list of actions.

    Check the box once you've decided if it is _atomic_, then click 'start tracking'.
