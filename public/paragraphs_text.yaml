    In essence, this is a FRACTAL habit tracker.

    To begin, enter an objective that you would like to pursue, or simply a habit that you would like to form.

  :new: Here is your chance to make a fresh start in one of your patterns of behavior. If you would like to 

  :old: Track the status of each of the sub-habits.

  :intro: >
    Since you've labelled this habit as *atomic*, we can break it down into a few simple actions which you can check off each day.

    Add items to the list - simple steps or 'things to remember' that will help you each day.

    Tick off items and it will save it for you automatically.

    Or, click 'Complete Habit for Today' to mark the habit as done for the day!

:existing_habit:
  :new: >
    You've created a new habit to track, so you're well on the way to establishing some new behavior.
    Now let's break it down into smaller pieces. 

  :old: >
    View the progress of your habit(s).
    
    If you have decided that a habit needs breaking down further, go to its *Summary* page and set it to **Atomic**.

    Go to the habit's *Objective* page to start stacking habits.

    If the habit is Atomic, click *Tasks* to create a list of simple steps.

  :sub_info: >
    We've given the habit a description, and a tag for the aspect of your life that it covers.
    Now we want to find out if this is an **atomic** habit, that we could reduce to a list of actions.

    Mark with a tick if you've decided if it is _atomic_, then click 'start tracking' to make it a simple list.
