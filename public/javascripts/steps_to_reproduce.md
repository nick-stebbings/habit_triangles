Steps to reproduce the interface (so you can see it working with multiple days on a single swiper):

1. Enter an objective name
2 Behind the scenes it will create 3 default 'cornerstone' habits, then take you to the dashboard for the first one.
3. Enter a valid description + hash tag. CHANGE the date of initiation to a few days ago.
4. Click update habit.
5. Click track habit. You should see an interface of one single swiper that you can move left and right.

By clicking the 'toggle' button, you can change the triangle for the current day from green to yellow and back.
